# Mindless
Full day loop script (aftercore farming -> softcore community service + farm -> casual + farm) that is an amalgamation of things hacked together with cli executes. 
This will likely only work for someone with a strict superset of my stuff. Much thanks to Thoth19, the dictator, zdrvst, kasekopf, assorted Garbo devs, and anyone else who advertently or inadvertently contritrbuted to this mess. 

* TimeTracking is a direct rip of Thoth's script
* ...which is pulling directly from some Dictator dependecies (profittracking, dictslibrary)
* You also need to have Garbage collector and Loop-Casual installed as they are both called. They can be found on the ASS discord. 
* My CS portion is a modified fork of c2t's script, which is also on my github.
